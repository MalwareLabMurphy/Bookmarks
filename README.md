# Bookmarks
A home for bookmarks that have proved useful in my duties as a security analyst/engineer.

It has come to my attention that certain organizations will block external email attachments, however, will not block access to GitHub repos. Although ultimately I understand and agree with the logic, it does make transferring bookmarks rather difficult.

Using this repo to provide a home for the raw HTML for my security bookmarks, for import into a web browser of choice. These have obviously been tailored/organized to my particular needs and whims, but if you happen to follow me and my line of work, perhaps you may see some valuable resources here as well.

Not quite what I expected for my first Github repo, but glad to start putting this page to good use all the same!
